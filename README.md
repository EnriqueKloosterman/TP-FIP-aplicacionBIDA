-	Interactive Help/Support Button = B I D A Panic Alarm! Is a modular and scalable solution that allows all devices linked to its database to send an alarm or SOS signal to their very own designated emergency contacts

Functionality
B I D A is a Panic Alarm! that was carefully thought out to assist people of all ages, who for different circumstances spend time alone in their lives. When you find yourself alone you’re at real risk of needing help, whether it be caused by a health issue, a violent situation like a robbery, an accident, or any matter that you can’t solve by yourself and requires urgent professional assistance.
B I D A Panic Alarm! is a multiplatform solution, redundant and manually o biometrically activated, for the user to get instant coverage with minimum requirements. It’s a simple app that can be installed in mobile phones, PCs, and a console version in the form of a necklace or a bracelet, completely autonomous whit up to 7 days of battery charge.
B I D A Panic Alarm! is designed to be adjusted according to the needs and preferences of the user. Its activation can be set to respond to diverse stimuli concurrent or exclusive. This response is indistinctive to audio stimuli (voice or predefined sounds), tactile stimuli with different points of contact (directly on the screen and buttons, or with another device such as the necklace, bracelet or push-button), biometric parameters (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, etc) and remote via BlueTooth and Wi-Fi.
Once the alarm is activated the system shoots a series of events predefined by the user that allow to automatically and instantly execute the help request and assistance protocol programmed previously. The system contemplates different types of confirmation responses to the different events that may shoot the protocol. In the waiting of this confirmation, in a certain lapse of time (also predetermined) it sends the signal for help redundantly to each contact that still hasn´t replied with the expected confirmation. By an auditory comeback it keeps the user updated on the state of the response from each event within the protocol.
